Question1-What is the use of float property? Which property is the better alternative to it?

Answer1-The float property in CSS was traditionally used to wrap text around images or create 
multi-column layouts. However, it has several limitations and can be tricky to work with:

Issues with float:

Creates complex clearing problems (need to use "clearfix" hacks)
Difficult to maintain consistent layouts
Can cause unexpected behavior with element heights

Better modern alternatives:

1.Flexbox

Perfect for one-dimensional layouts (either rows or columns)
Easy vertical centering
Flexible space distribution
Better control over element ordering

Ex:
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-itmes:center;
}

2.CSS Grid

Ideal for two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns together)
Built specifically for page layouts
More intuitive alignment controls
Better for responsive design
Ex:

.container{
    display:grid;
}
