Question2-Explain the difference between absolute and relative positions.

Answer2-Relative Positioning

Elements remain in the normal document flow
The element is positioned relative to its original position
Moving it (using top, right, bottom, left) doesn't affect other elements
Creates a positioning context for absolutely positioned child elements.

.relative-element {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;  /* Moves 20px down from original position */
  left: 10px; /* Moves 10px right from original position */
}

Absolute Positioning

Removes the element from the normal document flow
Positions relative to its nearest non-static positioned ancestor.
If no positioned ancestor exists, it positions relative to the viewport
Other elements act as if the absolute element doesn't exist.

.parent-element{
  position: relative; 
}

.absolute-element {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;  
  right: 0;
}
